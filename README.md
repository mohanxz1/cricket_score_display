🌐 CRICKET_SCORE_DISPLAY

A command-line developer tool designed to facilitate the presentation of real-time cricket scores, integrating detailed match data and player statistics into a cohesive and easily digestible display. This platform serves as a central hub for tracking and analyzing cricket match performance.

✨ Features
Comprehensive Data Management: Well-organized data structures for players (batsman, bowler), teams, and match details, enabling robust and comprehensive data management [cite: finaldef.c, image_5cf597.png].

Real-Time Data Input & Display: Supports dynamic score input during a match, ensuring users can record and view the latest match information as it happens [cite: finaldef.c, image_5cf597.png].

Detailed Performance Metrics: Tracks individual player performance metrics including runs scored, balls faced, boundaries (fours, sixes) for batsmen, and runs conceded, overs bowled, wickets taken, maiden overs, and economy for bowlers [cite: finaldef.c, image_5cf5bd.png].

Match Summary Generation: Generates a complete match summary, including total scores, total wickets, extras, highest individual batsman scores, and best bowling figures for both innings [cite: finaldef.c].

Match Result Determination: Automatically determines and displays the match result (win by runs, win by wickets, or tie) based on the recorded scores [cite: finaldef.c].

Persistent Data Storage: Saves all match details and summaries to text files for future reference and analysis, including team-specific player data and a global all_match_summaries.txt [cite: finaldef.c].

Overview
cricket_score_display is a developer tool that facilitates the presentation of real-time cricket scores, integrating detailed match data and player statistics into a cohesive display [cite: image_5cf597.png]. It serves as the backbone for building dynamic cricket scoreboards and analysis systems [cite: image_5cf597.png].

This project streamlines the process of tracking and displaying cricket match data [cite: image_5cf597.png].

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
To compile and run this C program, you will need:

A C compiler (e.g., GCC).

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mohanxz1/cricket_score_display.git
cd cricket_score_display


Compile the C code:

gcc finaldef.c -o cricket_score_display


Usage
To run the program and input match data:

Execute the compiled program:

./cricket_score_display


Follow the prompts:
The program will guide you through entering match details such as:

Team names (e.g., "India", "Australia") [cite: finaldef.c]

Venue (e.g., "Lords Cricket Ground") [cite: finaldef.c]

Date (e.g., "24,06,2025") [cite: finaldef.c]

Toss winner and their decision (bat or bowl) [cite: finaldef.c]

Number of batsmen and their individual statistics (runs in ones, twos, threes, fours, sixes, balls played) for both innings [cite: finaldef.c].

Number of bowlers and their individual statistics (runs given, overs bowled, wickets taken, maiden overs) for both innings [cite: finaldef.c].

Extras (wides, no-balls, byes, leg-byes) for each innings [cite: finaldef.c].

Navigate the Menu:
After all data is input, a menu will appear allowing you to view:

Individual batsman details for either team [cite: finaldef.c].

Individual bowler details for either team [cite: finaldef.c].

A complete match summary, including total scores, extras, highest batsman scores, and best bowling figures for both innings, and the final result [cite: finaldef.c].

The match summary will also be saved to a file named all_match_summaries.txt [cite: finaldef.c].

Testing
The provided code includes an interactive menu for viewing player statistics and a match summary, which serves as a form of functional testing for data accuracy and display.

To test the functionality:

Run the program as described in the Usage section.

Input various realistic and edge-case values for player statistics and extras.

Verify that the displayed individual player details and the overall match summary are accurate based on your inputs.

Check the all_match_summaries.txt file to ensure the match summary is correctly appended.
